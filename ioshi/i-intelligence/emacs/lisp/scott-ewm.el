;; Loaded from init.el only when emacs IS the compositor ((featurep 'ewm)).
;; Session helpers that must run as emacs subprocesses so they inherit
;; WAYLAND_DISPLAY and end with the session.

;; Input devices — libinput defaults to tap-to-click OFF; setopt (not
;; setq) so the compositor refresh runs. See `ewm-input-config' doc for
;; the full option set (natural-scroll, accel, xkb, per-device overrides).
